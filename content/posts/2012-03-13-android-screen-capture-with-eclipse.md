Taking a screen shot of your Android app with Eclipse is very easy, in
`Devices` view, select the `Screen Capture` tool from the toolbar with an
Android device or emulator selected. After that you could: `Refresh` to update
the view, `Rotate`, `Save` the screen shot or `Copy` the image to the
clipboard.

If you don't have the `Device` view opened, you could open it from `Window >
Show View > Other ...` menu option, in the new window you could type `Devices`
in the search field to filter the viewsÂ or open `Android` folder and select
`Devices` option.
